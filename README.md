Prompt for image generation 
Create a professional academic poster for a workshop titled 
"Foundations of Generative AI".

The poster should have a modern and futuristic design with
elements like artificial intelligence, neural networks,
digital brain, robots, and glowing technology patterns.

Use a clean layout suitable for a university environment.
Include space for details like date, time, and venue.
Color theme should be blue and purple with a high-resolution,
minimalistic, and professional look.

Prompt for video generation
Create a dynamic 30–40 second cinematic promotional VIDEO (not images, not explanations) for a university workshop titled:
“Generative AI Tools and Applications.”
The output must feel like a real-world moving video with continuous motion, camera movement, animated elements, and smooth transitions.
 Important Rules
•	Do NOT describe scenes
•	Do NOT explain visuals
•	Generate actual moving video content
•	Use camera motion, animated overlays, and transitions
•	Keep total duration under 40 seconds

Scene 1 | 6–8 seconds
Action & Motion
•	Fast zoom-in through flowing neural network lines
•	Pulsing digital brain forming from particles
•	Light data streams moving across the screen
•	Subtle camera pan and depth movement
On-screen text (animated fade-in):
“Generative AI is shaping the future of engineering”

Scene 2 | 10–12 seconds
Action & Motion
•	Smooth transition to real students typing on laptops
•	AI dashboards updating live
•	Cursor movements, code auto-completing
•	Floating UI elements sliding in and out
•	Slow cinematic left-to-right camera movement
On-screen text (appears sequentially):
“Workshop: Generative AI Tools and Applications”
“AI tools • Prompt Engineering • Real-world use cases”

Scene 3 | 8–10 seconds
Action & Motion
•	Students collaborating, pointing at screens
•	Holographic AI visuals expanding outward
•	Animated graphs and models rotating in 3D
•	Energy particles linking students and AI systems
•	Gentle camera orbit around the group
On-screen text (bold kinetic text):
“Hands-on learning for engineering students”
“Boost skills. Build the future.”

Scene 4 | 6–8 seconds
Action & Motion
•	Clean fade to dark blue background
•	Glowing animated lines converge to center
•	CTA text slides in with soft glow
•	Background particles slowly drifting
On-screen text:
“Register Now”
“Date | Time | Venue”

Overall Style
 Modern academic + tech cinematic feel
 Soft futuristic background music
 Smooth motion transitions (no hard cuts)
 Blue & purple color palette
 Minimal text, high visual impact
 Final instruction:
Generate this as a continuous animated video sequence, not static scenes or image descriptions.
